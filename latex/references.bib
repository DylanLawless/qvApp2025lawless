	abstract = {This study aimed to review the literature describing and quantifying time lags in the health research translation process. Papers were included in the review if they quantified time lags in the development of health interventions. The study identified 23 papers. Few were comparable as different studies use different measures, of different things, at different time points. We concluded that the current state of knowledge of time lags is of limited use to those responsible for R\&D and knowledge transfer who face difficulties in knowing what they should or can do to reduce time lags. This effectively ‘blindfolds’ investment decisions and risks wasting effort. The study concludes that understanding lags first requires agreeing models, definitions and measures, which can be applied in practice. A second task would be to develop a process by which to gather these data.},

Advances optimizing and economizing high-throughput sequencing have enabled a second phase of association studies that assess the contribution of rare variation to complex disease in all protein-coding genes. Unlike the early microarray-based studies, sequencing-based studies catalogue the full range of genetic variation, including the evolutionarily youngest forms. Although the experience with common variants helped establish relevant standards for genome-wide studies, the analysis of rare variation introduces several challenges that require novel analysis approaches.},
