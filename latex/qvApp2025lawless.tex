\textbf{Motivation:} \\[1ex]
Qualifying variants (QVs) are genomic alterations selected by defined criteria within analysis pipelines. Although crucial for both research and clinical diagnostics, QVs are often seen as simple filters rather than dynamic elements that influence the entire workflow. While best practices follow variant classification standards and standardised workflows, a unified framework to integrate and optimise QVs for advanced applications is missing.
\\[1ex]
\noindent
\textbf{Results:} \\[1ex]
Our aim is to embed the concept of a ``QV'' into the genomic analysis vernacular, moving beyond a single filtering step. By decoupling QV criteria from other pipeline variables and code, our approach facilitates easier discussion and application.
Our framework, with its new terminology and reference model, offers a flexible approach for integrating QVs into analysis pipelines, thereby enhancing reproducibility, interpretability, and interdisciplinary communication.
A validation case study implementing ACMG criteria in a disease cohort shows that our approach matches conventional methods while offering improved clarity and scalability.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

% Background: Define QVs and their role in genomic analysis.
\ac{qv}s are genomic alterations selected by specific criteria within genome processing pipelines, serving as dynamic elements essential for both research and clinical diagnostics. 
\ac{qv}s are not merely static filters applied at a single step in an analysis pipeline; rather, they are dynamic, multifaceted elements that permeate the entire workflow, from initial data quality control to final result interpretation. This nuanced perspective underscores that \ac{qv}s play an integral role in shaping the fidelity and reproducibility of genomic analyses, enabling the iterative refinement of data and facilitating the integration of diverse analytical strategies throughout the pipeline.

% Background/Rationale: Discuss existing practices and identify the gap.
Often, \ac{qv} selection adheres to established variant classification and reporting standards \cite{richards2015standards, li2017standards, li2017intervar, riggs2020technical, tavtigian2020fitting} and standardised workflows \cite{pedersen2021effective, anderson2010data, uffelmann2021genome}. 
However a unified framework for \ac{qv}s is lacking, despite the recognised benefits of similar initiatives, such as \ac{prs} reporting standards \cite{wand2021improving, lambert2021polygenic}.
For instance, tools like vcfexpress \cite{pedersen_vcfexpress_2025} enable flexible, rapid filtering and formatting of VCF files using user-defined expressions. The application of independently defined \ac{qv} criteria would complement such tools.
This role is particularly important for reproducibility across distributed computing environments \cite{bal_programming_1989} and would also integrate with workflow managers such as Snakemake \cite{molder_sustainable_2021} or Nextflow \cite{di_tommaso_nextflow_2017}, streamlining genomic processing tasks.

% Background: Outline the variability in QV selection and provide examples.
The criteria for \ac{qv} selection vary by application. 
For example, \ac{gwas} may focus on common variants, while clinical analyses usually target rare or known pathogenic variants. 
Previous studies have demonstrated the utility of \ac{qv}s \cite{povysil2019rare, cirulli2015exome}, yet no common approach exists. 
Here, we detail four typical applications of \ac{qv} sets:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{\ac{qv} passing \ac{qc} only}: Generates large datasets (e.g. > 500,000 variants per subject) for \ac{gwas} or initial \ac{wgs} pre-processing.
    \item \textbf{Flexible \ac{qv}}: Balances between \ac{qc} and false positives, yielding intermediate datasets (e.g. fewer than 100,000 variants per subject) for uses such as rare variant association testing.
    \item \textbf{\ac{qv} for rare disease}: Applies stringent filtering to produce smaller datasets (e.g. < 1,000 variants per subject), targeting known genes or single causal variants.
    \item \textbf{Known disease panel \ac{qv} set}: Focuses on well-established gene panels with pathogenic variants (e.g. the \ac{acmg} \ac{sf} set) for clinical reporting \cite{miller2023acmg}.
\end{enumerate}

% Background/Rationale: Emphasise the importance of careful QV selection.
 These examples illustrate a few common applications without providing an exhaustive classification of all possible \ac{qv} uses.
The careful selection and categorisation of \ac{qv}s are thus critical for accurate reporting and reproducibility, sometimes even more so than the choice of the analysis pipeline itself \cite{olson2023variant}.

% Background: Address the increasing need for diverse QV protocols in large-scale sequencing.
As \ac{wgs} becomes standard for large cohorts \cite{lee2018gene, jansen2019genome}, the integration of diverse \ac{qv} protocols is critical for data cleaning and analysis. 
During sequencing analysis several layers can be responsible for triggering \ac{qv} protocols, including
pre-existing metadata, technical \ac{qc} results, and post-calling annotations,
highlighting the need for a clear, unified approach. 

% Framework: Present the proposed solution.
We propose treating the \ac{qv} as a standalone entity, independent from other pipeline variables. We suggest structured human- and machine-readable criteria, aligned with FAIR principles \cite{wilkinson2016fair} to facilitate integration across databases \cite{van2023bridging, toure2023fairification}. We advocate for the use of standard vocabularies, unique identifiers, and flexible file formats to support this integration.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Implementation} \label{sec:framework}

%By introducing a new vocabulary and a standard reference model for \ac{qv}s, we aim to clarify the concept and improve communication and methodological discussion across disciplines for more advanced tasks.
Implementation configurations and roles within analysis pipelines include, for example:
theoretical pipelining of \ac{qv} sets,
establishing public or standardised \ac{qv} sets for specific analytical scenarios, and 
recognition that \ac{qv}s are integral throughout the analysis pipeline rather than confined to a single end-stage.
We introduce a simple framework for the effective use of \ac{qv} protocols, comprising four components as illustrated in \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:qv_pipeline_with_file_vcurrent_guru_case_study_result} (A)}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{1. Variables}: The criteria variables sourced as part of the pipeline (see \textbf{Box \ref{box:acmg_criteria_yaml}}).
    \item \textbf{2a. Technical description}: An optional narrative detailing each step within the overall \ac{qv} set (see \textbf{Box \ref{box:acmg_criteria_yaml}}).
    \item \textbf{2b. \ac{ppi} description}: An optional narrative providing a patient-focused interpretation of the protocol, incorporating preferences and priorities.
    \item \textbf{3. \ac{qv} set ID}: A unique identifier that links analysis records.
    \item \textbf{4. Source code}: The implementation of the variables file within the pipeline code, for example through custom scripts or workflow managers.
\end{itemize}

We propose the \ac{qv} set ID as a unique identifier linking variant sets used in analyses. This facilitates integration into databases,
by representing data in formats such as \ac{rdf} schemas \cite{toure2023fairification}, and allows for features including \ac{sha256} hash functions, \ac{uuid}s, semantic combinations, \ac{iri} incorporation, registry-based allocation, and standard mapping such as \ac{snomedct}. The results can be used alongside other genomic-specific concepts spanning from sample processing to the sequencing run \cite{van2023bridging}.

This framework efficiently manages \ac{qv}-specific variables (e.g. allele frequency thresholds) separately from general pipeline settings, ensuring clarity and specificity. Its versatile format supports applications across genomic analyses and by linking the \ac{qv} set ID to both results and raw data sources in a database for downstream interpretation and reporting.

\subsection{Example application of qualifying variants in WGS analysis}

Multiple \ac{qv} protocols can be combined to generate progressively filtered datasets tailored to specific analytical needs. Often, different \ac{qv} sets are applied sequentially, with the final outcomes merged to address distinct objectives. For instance, a comprehensive analysis pipeline might integrate:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \colorbox{kispiblue!05}{\texttt{QV SNV/INDEL}}  \ac{snvindel},
  \item \colorbox{kispiblue!05}{\texttt{QV CNV}} \ac{cnv},
  \item \colorbox{kispiblue!05}{\texttt{QV structural variation}},
  \item \colorbox{kispiblue!05}{\texttt{QV rare disease known}}, and 
  \item \colorbox{kispiblue!05}{\texttt{QV statistical association \ac{qc}}}.
\end{itemize}
The final analysis yields (1) a joint cohort disease association (e.g. variant P-values) and (2) individual single-case results (e.g. clinical genetics diagnosis for a patient)
\cite{auwera_genomics_2020, li2025statistical}.
As an example, in 
\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:qv_pipeline_with_file_vcurrent_guru_case_study_result} (A)}
we focus on a SNV/INDEL pipeline employing two \ac{qv} sets:
\colorbox{colorSUNSET2!20}{\texttt{QV SNV INDEL 1}} for flexible cohort-level filtering, and 
\colorbox{colorSUNSET2!20}{\texttt{QV SNV INDEL 2}} for stricter filtering in subsequent single-case analysis. The pipeline is illustrated in \textbf{Box \ref{box:pipe}}, and can be summarised as follows:

``A cohort of patient WGS data was analysed to identify genetic determinants for phenotype X. Initially, a flexible \ac{qv} set was applied using the 
\colorbox{colorSUNSET1!10}{\texttt{pipeline DNA SNV INDEL v1}}, which implements the \colorbox{colorSUNSET2!20}{\texttt{QV SNV INDEL 1}} criteria to produce the prepared dataset (\colorbox{colorSUNSET3!10}{\texttt{dataset DNA SNV INDEL v1}}). This dataset was then analysed alongside other modules (e.g. \colorbox{colorSUNSET4!10}{\texttt{PCA SNV INDEL v1}} and \colorbox{colorSUNSET5!10}{\texttt{statistical genomics v1}}) to derive a cohort-level association signal (Result 1). Next, the same prepared dataset was re-filtered with the stricter \colorbox{colorSUNSET2!20}{\texttt{QV SNV INDEL 2}} criteria to identify known causal variants for each patient, yielding the final dataset (\colorbox{colorSUNSET3!10}{\texttt{dataset DNA SNV INDEL v2}}) and resulting in individual case reports (Result 2).''

\subsection{Usage in a rare disease Validation Study}

In a validation study, we demonstrate the use of our \ac{qv} criteria framework 
% achieve a 100\% match in criterion application when 
compared to the conventional manual approach. 
This analysis was performed on an in-house rare disease cohort of 940 individuals, which had been pre-processed for \ac{qc}. % and filtered using a minimal \ac{qv} test set.
We used genome-wide set of variants which was filtering to target rare varaints (\ac{maf} $< 0.01$) restricted to known disease genes based on the Genomics England panel ``Primary immunodeficiency or monogenic inflammatory bowel disease,'' retrieved using our PanelAppRex R repository (\url{https://github.com/DylanLawless/PanelAppRex}) 
\cite{lawless_panelapprex_2025}. 
This provided us with a prepared dataset of 6026 candidate variants annotated with 376 information sources.
The dataset was prepared in R using GuRu, our variant interpretation tool that consolidates all annotation sources and scores variants as candidate causal, and was imported from gVCF format as output by \ac{vep}.

%Initially, we implemented an \ac{acmg} variant classification protocol \cite{richards2015standards} manually. 
%We then re-implemented the same protocol using the new framework for \ac{qv} criteria in YAML format. 
We selected the first eight \ac{acmg} criteria for assigning pathogenicity scores to variants \cite{richards2015standards}; six of these were relevant for this cohort. First, the analysis was performed manually by hard-coding each criterion in the pipeline script, reflecting a typical workflow. Second, the same criteria were imported from the \ac{qv} YAML file for the new framework approach, using the file ``qv acmg svnindel criteria 20250225.yaml'' (see \textbf{Box \ref{box:acmg_criteria_yaml}} or \url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15105594}).
The outputs from both methods were captured and compared.

Additional details of the YAML criteria in this \ac{qv} set included definitions for \texttt{ACMG\_PS1} (identifying previously established pathogenic amino acid changes), \texttt{ACMG\_PS3} (supporting functional studies with matching inheritance patterns), and \texttt{ACMG\_PS5} (covering compound heterozygosity with high-impact variants). The criteria for \texttt{ACMG\_PM2} and \texttt{ACMG\_PM3} assess variant frequency and in trans occurrences, respectively, while \texttt{PS2} and \texttt{PS4} were not applicable to this cohort.

% Individual steps within the \ac{qv} criteria can be further classified for organisational purposes using simple labels such as ``QC'' and ``filter''. For example, filtering thresholds (e.g. allele frequency > 0.1 in a cohort, < 0.1 in gnomAD) may be applied directly to exclude variants, while annotation-based criteria (e.g. QC flags) might not remove variants outright but instead inform downstream analyses that integrate multiple \ac{qv} filters.

% The following example of box 2 can be reproduced using the qv_builder.html with the prompt:
% ```
% criteria ACMG_PVS1 logic=and description="Null variants (IMPACT == HIGH) in genes where loss of function causes disease. Includes homozygous variants, compound heterozygous cases, or dominant inheritance. Warning to phase check compound heterozygosity."
% criteria ACMG_PVS1 field=IMPACT operator="==" value=HIGH
% criteria ACMG_PVS1 group=any_of:start
% criteria ACMG_PVS1 field=genotype operator="==" value=2

% criteria ACMG_PVS1 field=comp_het_flag operator="==" value=1
% criteria ACMG_PVS1 group=any_of:end
% 
% ```
% which means:
% IMPACT == HIGH and (genotype == 2 or Inheritance == AD or (count by sample,SYMBOL >= 2 and comp_het_flag == 1))

\subsection{Usage in a GWAS validation study}

We next applied the \ac{qv} criteria framework to a genome-wide association study using HapMap3 Phase 3 (R3) consensus genotypes. The analysis was performed twice: first as a conventional hard coded pipeline (Phase~1), and second using an externalised \ac{qv} YAML configuration file (Phase~2). Both pipelines used the same data and processing stages, ensuring comparability.  

The hard coded implementation embedded all filtering and analysis thresholds directly in the bash scripts, while the QV-based implementation sourced them from the file ``qv\_gwas\_common\_v1\_20250826.yaml'' (see \url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX}). This QV set defines common GWAS thresholds: restriction to autosomal, biallelic SNPs; minimum sample call rate of $95\%$; variant call rate of $95\%$; minor allele frequency $\geq 1\%$; and Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium $p \geq 1\times10^{-6}$. After quality control, variants were LD-pruned and principal components (PC1–PC10) were computed, with sex included as an additional covariate. Logistic regression under an additive model was then performed with PLINK.  

The outputs of the two pipelines were captured and compared across each main PLINK stage: step1 (autosomal biallelic SNPs), step2 (sample call rate), step3 (variant call rate), step4 (minor allele frequency), step5 (Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium), and step6 (association results). Manhattan plots, PCA plots, and \texttt{md5} checksums were used to confirm exact reproducibility between the hard coded and QV-driven analyses.

\subsection{Usage in a WGS validation study with GIAB and Exomiser}

We validated the \ac{qv} approach on the Genome In A Bottle Chinese Trio (HG005-HG007, PRJNA200694, GRCh38 v4.2.1) using a two-phase trio pipeline that differs only in how parameters are provided: Phase 1 hard coded thresholds in scripts, while Phase 2 externalised the same thresholds in a \ac{qv} YAML file. Both phases applied identical \ac{qc} and study filters and additionally demonstrated gene-panel style analysis using the PanelAppRex paediatric disorders panel (panel\_486; 3{,}853 genes). The upstream configuration demonstrated a range of \ac{qv} settings used, including region restriction by BED overlap, site-level thresholds on QUAL and INFO/DP with computed site depth from per-sample FORMAT/DP if absent, per-sample thresholds on FORMAT/DP and FORMAT/GQ with exclusion of missing GT, and composite criteria that require either all samples to pass or at least one sample to pass. Upstream processing used \texttt{bcftools} for region filtering, tag filling, site depth range, and per-sample filters. The filtered trio \ac{vcf} was analysed with Exomiser using a trio \texttt{.ped} and no \ac{hpo}. 

\section{Results}
\subsection{Validation rare disease case study}

We validated our \ac{qv} protocol using \ac{acmg}-based criteria for a rare disease cohort of 940 individuals. 
We then conducted the variant classification using two approaches: a conventional manual method with hard-coded criteria, and our new YAML-based implementation.
As shown in \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:qv_pipeline_with_file_vcurrent_guru_case_study_result} (B)}, 
the outputs from both methods were identical, demonstrating a 100\% match. This confirmed that our framework of a standalone, shareable, \ac{qv} criteria file can be imported and applied programmatically with equivalent accuracy, providing a reproducible resource that is adaptable across different pipelines and programming environments.

\subsection{Validation in a common variant GWAS}

we dont need redundant repetition of values and steps 1-6. just leave it in methods. 

We validated the \ac{qv} approach in a standard HapMap3 Phase 3 GWAS by running two equivalent analyses: a hard coded pipeline and a \ac{qv} YAML driven pipeline that externalised all quality control and analysis thresholds. Both used autosomal biallelic \ac{snp}s with sample call rate $\geq 95\%$, variant call rate $\geq 95\%$, minor allele frequency $\geq 1\%$, and Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium $p \geq 1\times10^{-6}$, followed by LD pruning and inclusion of sex and PC1-PC10 as covariates in logistic regression. As shown in \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:hapmap_gwas_validation}} panels A and B, the Manhattan and PCA plots were indistinguishable between methods. Panel C shows identical \texttt{md5} checksums for the main PLINK outputs across stages: step 1 (autosomal biallelic SNPs), step 2 (sample call rate), step 3 (variant call rate), step 4 (minor allele frequency), step 5 (Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium), and step 6 (association results). These results demonstrate exact reproducibility of the hard coded workflow using a shareable \ac{qv} criteria file, confirming that \ac{qv} parameterisation preserves analytic intent while improving clarity and reuse.

MD5 checksums of the main PLINK outputs — step1 (autosomal, biallelic SNPs), step2 (sample call rate), step3 (variant call rate), step4 (minor allele frequency), step5 (Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium), and step6 (association results) — are identical between phases A and B. The QV file encodes these thresholds (sample call rate $\geq$95\%, variant call rate $\geq$95\%, MAF $\geq$1\%, HWE p $\geq$1e-6, autosomal biallelic SNPs only) together with covariates (sex and PC1-PC10) and logistic regression settings. This demonstrates that a shareable QV file reproduces hard-coded pipelines exactly while improving transparency and reusability.}

We conducted the trio analysis using a standard filtering approach and the popular Exomiser tool for variant annotation and interpretation pipeline. Again we tested the conventional manual hard-coded criteria to our new YAML-based implementation

Both phases produced identical outputs. Upstream file-level counts matched at each step and Exomiser annotation and filtering metrics were the same in both phases, resolving to the same candidate set and reported variants. 
\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:qv_exomiser_validation} (A)}
summarises upstream processing counts by file, \textbf{(B)} shows equality of Exomiser metrics, and \textbf{(C)} presents the key variant fields used for reporting. Together these results confirm that a shareable \ac{qv} file reproduces a hard coded workflow exactly while improving clarity and reuse on top of existing popular methods.

\subsection{Implications}
% Framework: Highlight the clinical relevance and benefits.
In the validation study, we applied \ac{acmg} criteria for variant interpretation. In clinical genetics, for instance, the resulting output can be used to retrieve candidate pathogenic variants using \ac{acmg} scoring methods \cite{richards2015standards, tavtigian2020fitting}.
Application of additional \ac{qv} sets, such as the widely used \ac{acmg} \ac{sf} set for clinical reporting \cite{miller2023acmg}, can be used to confirm any secondary findings.

In a clinical setting it is necessary to bridge the gap between technical detail and lay understanding. By explicitly documenting variant qualifying criteria and making \ac{qv} data accessible, our framework builds trust and supports meaningful \ac{ppi} \cite{morris_answer_2011}. The \ac{qv} file adapts by integrating the main criteria variables with optionally dedicated fields for both technical description and \ac{ppi} description. This approach captures the analysis intent defined by the \ac{qv} set creator and embeds patient preferences from the start. 

For example, patient preferences recorded in the \ac{ppi} description can be automatically incorporated into a genetic report without additional interpretation, ensuring clarity and consistency throughout the analysis. This transparency guarantees that both experts and laypersons receive information in a format suited to their needs, thereby improving diagnostic traceability and accelerating the translation of genetic research into clinical practice.
